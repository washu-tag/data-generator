The imaging study shows some sort of features that may or may not be interesting. It is possible that the body part or body parts that were being imaged in the study have some sort of abnormal result. It is also possible that the results are all totally normal, I'm not really sure. I think I see something interesting in the images, but maybe we should get some different images to be sure.
