ACC#  Date Time  Exam

EXAMINATION:
Cardiac NM study

FINDINGS:
The cardiac nuclear medicine study reveals preserved left ventricular
function with an ejection fraction estimated at ±60%÷. Symmetrical
stress and rest perfusion are noted with no significant perfusion
defects observed in the myocardial segments. The wall motion is
normal during rest and following stress induction. There is no
evidence of hyperdynamic motion, and the chamber size appears within
normal limits. No abnormal radiotracer uptake or extra-cardiac
findings are seen.

IMPRESSION:
The results of the cardiac NM study demonstrate normal perfusion with
preserved cardiac function. There is no evidence of ischemia or
infarction, and there are no abnormalities suggestive of cardiac
pathology. These findings are reassuring and consistent with normal
cardiac health.
