EXAMINATION: Single-view X-ray

IMPRESSION: 
The single-view X-ray findings are within normal limits, showing no
significant changes or abnormalities compared to prior studies. The
single-view X-ray performed on 2015-11-29 presents normal alignment
and ossification of the bony structures assessed. There are no
evident signs of osteopenia, fratures, or degenerative changes. The
soft tissues are unremarkable, with visualized joints appearing
well-maintained. No pathology that requires further investigation is
noted, indicating a stable radiographic appearance without any acute
concerns.
